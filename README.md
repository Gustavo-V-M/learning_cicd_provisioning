# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Personal Project

This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) resources for my **learning CI/CD**. The infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, and the server configuration is managed with **Ansible**.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── terraform/      # Contains Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning
├── ansible/        # Contains Ansible playbooks and roles for server configuration
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml # pre-commit hooks configuration
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (version 1.x or higher)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (version 2.9 or higher)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for Ansible dependencies)
- A configured cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) with appropriate credentials.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

Navigate to the `terraform/` directory and follow these steps:

1. Initialize Terraform:
  
  ```bash
  cd terraform
  terraform init
  ```
  
2. Preview the infrastructure changes:
  
  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```
  
3. Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure:
  
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```
  
  > **Note:** Ensure your cloud provider credentials are correctly configured before running the `terraform apply` command.
  

### 3. Server Configuration with Ansible

After provisioning the infrastructure, navigate to the `ansible/` directory to configure the servers:

1. Install required Python dependencies:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
2. Update the inventory file (`ansible/inventory`) with the IP addresses or hostnames of the provisioned servers.
  
3. Run the Ansible playbooks:
  
  ```bash
  cd ansible
  ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
  ```
  
  > Replace `site.yml` with the name of the main playbook if it's different.
  

## Customization

- **Terraform:** Modify the `.tf` files in the `terraform/` directory to customize the infrastructure according to your needs.
- **Ansible:** Update the playbooks and roles in the `ansible/` directory to define specific configurations for your servers.

## Notes

- Ensure that you destroy the infrastructure when no longer needed to avoid unnecessary costs:
  
  ```bash
  cd terraform
  terraform destroy
  ```
  
- For sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords), use environment variables or tools like [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) or [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html).
